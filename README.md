The data offered (click the above link) includes a variety of characteristics and features related to secondhand autos. The price of used automobiles is the target variable, the main focus of the analysis, and it is expressed in lakhs. This dataset is tabular in nature, with rows and columns denoting individual used car listings and columns denoting specific characteristics or features of these vehicles. Features include: car make and model; location or city of sale; year of manufacture; mileage; odometer (kilometers driven); fuel type (petrol or diesel); type of transmission (manual or automatic); number of owners; and any other information. Engine displacement, horsepower, number of seats, and price of the vehicle. With this data, carry out the following actions: a) Find the missing values in each column and either remove them or impute them using the mean, median, or mode. Explain what you're doing for this task. b) Take out the units from some of the properties and leave only the integer values (remove kmpl from “Mileage”, CC from “Engine”, bhp from “Power”, and lakh from “New_price”). C) Convert the categorical variables "Transmission" and "Fuel Type" to a single hot encoded number. d) Add a new feature to the dataset by creating a new column (you can use R's mutate function for this). For instance, by deducting the current year from the "Year" column, you may determine the age of the car today.
